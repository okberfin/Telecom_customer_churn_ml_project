# Telecom_customer_churn_ml_project
### Project Overview
This  project aims to guide a telecom company to identify their potential customers who are likely to churn. Connections between customer characteristics and behaviours were found through exploratory data analysis. Machine learning model built with 7 different classification algorithm(Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, Perceptron, Decision Tree). Four algorithms with highest cross validation score have chosen for further ml process. Since the dataset is imbalanced, all models were also built with different oversampling methods(Random Over Sampler, SMOTE, Adasyn, BorderlineSMOTE). Before deciding the final model, model optimizations were made by hyperparameter tuning with gridsearchcv.
### Data Sources
Telecom churn dataset ("WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn[1].csv" ) is obtained from Kaggle. 
### Tools
